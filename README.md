# Flexigift Service

This repository contains the code, data, and API documentation for the Flexigift gift card management 
service. Flexigift is a fictional product that allows users to spend their third-party gift cards directly at 
their Amazon.com shopping carts.

## Overview

I wrote this documentation as part of a class where we set up a product team including:

+ a **product owner** who defined the features and designed the database,
+ a **technical writer** (me) who wrote the API docs,
+ a **technical editor** who verified that the docs were accurate and met minimum style standards, and
+ a **usability tester** who verified that the documents accurately described some common use cases.

Our product team collaborated throughout the publishing process through regular sprint reviews.

Flexigift does not actually integrate with Amazon.com, but the code runs and the code samples are 
valid and can be run against a local instance of the service.

## Plans for these docs

The Flexigift APIThese are living documents; I continually add new topics, expand existing topics, and try out new 
formatting and ideas.
