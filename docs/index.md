# Flexigift service API

The Flexigift service allows customers to spend their third-party gift cards directly in their Amazon.com shopping cart. Flexigift users first link their various gift cards from companies like Nike, Starbucks, or Hanes to their account. Then when they buy eligible products from Amazon.com they are given the option to pay from one of their third-party gift cards.

Use Flexigift's REST interface to manage users, gift cards, and eligible products.
