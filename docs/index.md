# Flexigift Service

Spend all of your gift cards at Amazon.com with Flexigift!

With the Flexigift service, you can spend your third-party gift cards directly at your Amazon.com 
shopping cart. First, [create a Flexigift account](tutorials/add-a-user.md) and 
[add some gift cards](tutorials/add-a-gift-card.md). Next, [link your gift cards](tutorials/link-card-to-user.md) 
from companies like Nike, Starbucks, or Hanes to your Flexigift account. Finally, when you buy eligible 
products from Amazon.com, your Amazon shopping card will give you the option to pay with one of your 
third-party gift cards.

The Flexigift service offers a [REST API](api/index.md) to manage users, gift cards, and eligible 
products, and to record purchase transactions.
