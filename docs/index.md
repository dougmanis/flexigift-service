# Flexigift Service

Spend all of your gift cards at Amazon.com with Flexigift! With the Flexigift service, you can spend 
your third-party gift cards directly at your Amazon.com shopping cart.

## How it works

Third-party gift cards issuers such as Kohl's and Starbucks register their eligible products with 
Flexigift. Flexigift users link their gift cards to their account. When a Flexigift user adds an 
eligible product to their Amazon.com shopping cart, Amazon verifies their third-party gift card with Flexigift and 
offers the user the option to pay for their item with their card.
