# Flexigift service API

Spend all of your gift cards at Amazon.com with Flexigift!

The Flexigift service allows customers to spend their third-party gift cards directly in their 
Amazon.com shopping cart. Flexigift users first link their various gift cards from companies like Nike, 
Starbucks, or Hanes to their Flexigift account. Then when they buy eligible products from Amazon.com 
they are given the option to pay with one of their third-party gift cards.

Use Flexigift's REST API to manage users, gift cards, and eligible products.
