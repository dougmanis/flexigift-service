# Flexigift service API

The Flexigift service allows customers to spend their third-party gift cards directly in their 
Amazon.com shopping cart. Flexigift users first link their various gift cards from companies like Nike, 
Starbucks, or Hanes to their Flexigift account. Then when they buy eligible products from Amazon.com they are 
given the option to pay from one of those third-party gift cards.

Use Flexigift's REST API to manage users, gift cards, and eligible products.

## API reference

The Flexigift services offers four resources:

### [Users](api/users/index.md)

### [Gift cards](api/gift-cards/index.md)

### [Products](api/products/index.md)

### [Transactions](api/transactions/index.md)

**Note**: The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they
refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service. When Flexigift is run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is
generally `http://localhost:3000`.
