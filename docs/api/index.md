# Flexigift REST API specifications

Detailed descriptions of the Flexigift service's resources.

**Note**: The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they
refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends
on the installation of the service. When Flexigift is run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is
generally `http://localhost:3000`.

Flexigift maintains four resources:

* [Gift Cards](gift-cards/index.md)
* Users
* Products
* Transactions
