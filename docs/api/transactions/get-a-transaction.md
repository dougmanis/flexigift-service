> **Note**: The service always responds with HTTP status 200 even for transactions that do not exist in the system. Instead of returning status 404 (Not Found), the service returns an empty data set.
>
> For example, searching for non-existing transaction 999:
>
> ```bash
> curl -GET "http://localhost:3000/transactions/999"
> ```
>
> returns:
>
> ```json
> {}
> ```
